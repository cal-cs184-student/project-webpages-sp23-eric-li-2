		<h1> Project 2 Overview </h1>
		<p>
			In this project I implemented 1d Bezier curves in 2 dimensions using Casteljau's algorithm.
			Casteljau's algorithm is a technique of using successive LERPs to evaluate the location of a point on the curve. 
			Then I implemented 2d Bezier surfaces also using Casteljau's algorithm.
			Additionally, I implemented an area weighted vertex normal calculator which could be used for Blinn phong lighting calculations. 
			This was done efficiently using the halfedge datastructure.

			Finally, I implemented loop division to define surfaces in terms of control points. 
			The loop division algorithm subdivides the mesh and converges on a final mesh. 
			It tends to make edges and vertices smoother after each subdivision.
			So it is possible to start from a very coarse mesh like a cube and end up with something roughly spherical.
		</p>
		<h1> Part 1 Bezier curves</h1>
		<p>
			Casteljau's algorithm is a technique to evaluate the location of a point on a bezier curve given a number t from the range [0,1]. 
			t = 0 represents the start of the curve and t=1 represents the end.
			Casteljau's provides an implicit parametrization of the curve in terms of t ranging from [0,1] and provides the means to compute 
			the location of the point with successive lerp operations between the control points.
			Starting from n control points, n-1 control points are then generated with a lerp using p_i' = (1-t)*p_i + t*p_i 
			this is done recursively until only 1 control point remains which represents the point on the bezier curve.
			My implementation uses a std::vector of Vector2D control points. I then perform the lerp operation to generate 
			a vector 1 shorter than before. I do this till their is one element left.
		</p>

			Here is an example of a Bezier curve with 6 control points. Images are ordered left to right, then top to bottom <br>

		<h1> Part 2: Bezier Surfaces </h1>
		<p>
			Casteljau's algorithm can be extended to surfaces by using a 2d grid of control points and a parameter (u,v) where u,v in [0,1]. 
			Casteljau's is first run normally on each row of the control points with parameter t = u to generate a single control point for each row.
			Then using the control points we got for each row, we run Casteljau's again with t = v.
			This gives us the final point that lies on the bezier surface.
			This is exactly what my code does. I run casteljau on each row, place these new control points in a new vector. Then run casteljau again.

		<h1> Part 3: Area weighted vertex normals </h1>
		<p> I implemented area weighted vertex normals using the half edge datastructure. 
			The area weighted vertex normal is a normal vector calculated based on the normals of the adjacent faces.
			The normals of the adjacent faces area added together with their weight equal to their surface area. 
			The normal was calculated using the cross product and the area was also calculated using the cross product. 

			In my implemntation I simply added the cross products of all the adjacent faces then normalized the final vector. 
			The cross product's magnitude was equal to the surface area of the face which accounted for the weighting.

			The half edge datastructure allowed me to do all of this efficiently by letting me traverse the graph with a datastructure similar to a linked list.
			Each half edge had a pointer to the next half edge along the face going in a counterclockwise direction. Each halfedge also had a twin which could be used 
			to come back to the original vertex or to traverse onto an adjacent face.

			With the half edge datastructure i was able to iterate over all the surrounding vertices of a vertex.

		</table>
		<p> As you can see the render on the right with the vertex normals has a much smoother lighting compared to the render on the left. 
			The render on the left only uses flat surface lighting using the normal of a face for the light intesity calculation.
			The render on te right uses interpolation to calculate the normal of points in the interior of the polygon using a weighted sum of the vertex normals. 
			I am not sure what interpolation was used in the code we were provided but it is likely barycentric interpolation since it the most simple and provideds decent results.
			Other interpolation technqiues could be used but I have not tried them.
		</p>
		<h1> Part 4: Edge Flip operation </h1>
		<p> 
			I implemented the edge flip operation by reassigning the pointers between the existing edges, half_edges, faces, and vertices.
			No new mesh elements needed to be created since the mesh had the same number of elements before and after flip.
			Some debugging issues I ran into was my use of the word "auto" and "auto&". Using "auto&" seemed to cause a lot of issues and messed with reassigning member variables of the half edges. 
			I was not very familiar with references and iterators so I avoided using auto&.

			To help with debugging I made a map that mapped iterators to a name such as "ab" or "bc" and passed it into the check_for function.
			This helped make the debugging output more legible and I did not need to match memory adresses to figure what each of the half edges were pointing to.
			This use of map also really helped me pinpoint the absolute chaos caused by using auto&. 
			A topic I should study in the future is how references to iterators behave and how references of references behave.

		<h1> Part5: Edge split operation </h1>
		<p> 
			I implemented the edge split operation similarly to the edge flip operation.
			The split created 6 new half edges, 3 new edges, 3 new faces, and 1 new vertex. 
			These were created at the end of the linked list. 
			I reused the old edges, faces, halfedges, and vertices by simply reassigning what mesh objects they pointed to such their halfedge member variable.
			I avoided deleting any old variables for efficiency reasons. 

			After creating the new mesh elements, I needed to assign all their member variables to point to the correct elements.
			This was done systematically with a picture diagram on the left side of my screen and the code on my right. 
			I assigned the half edges in triplets for each triangle and did this four times for each quadrant of the split triangles. 

			For debugging, I again used the map from halfedges to names which let me read the debug info easily without deciphering memory adresses since 
			the hashmap deciphered the memory adresses for me.
		</p>
		<p> Here is an example of a mesh before and after some edge splits </p>

		<h1> Part 6: Loop Subdivision </h1>
		<p> 
			The behavior of the meshes is that they tend to round off corners and edges but not entirely. 
			Here are some screenshots of a cube being rounded off by the subdivision process.
		</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th> <img src=".\img\task6_1.PNG" alt="task6_1.PNG"> </th>
				<th> <img src=".\img\task6_2.PNG" alt="task6_2.PNG"> </th>
			</tr>

				<th> <img src=".\img\task6_3.PNG" alt="task6_3.PNG"> </th>
				<th> <img src=".\img\task6_4.PNG" alt="task6_4.PNG"> </th>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>	
			This rounding off process can be reduced by pre-splitting 
			some of the edges along a corner / edge to increase the number of polygons along the edge. This acts like a buffer for the smoothing process 
			as the smoothing really starts along the corners and slowly spreads into the interior of the shape. Some pictures below show this buffering in action.

				<th> <img src=".\img\task6_18.PNG" alt="task6_18.PNG"> </th>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<p> 
			Another observation is that the subdivision of the cube is senstiive to the starting mesh topology. 
			After a couple of subdivisions, the cube ends up assymetric due to how each square face is divded into 2 triangles.
			There are two possible topologies for each face depending on which diagonal was used. 
			This can be mitigated with some preprocessing to make the mesh topology symmetrical before subdvision starts.
			In the exam below, I preprocessed the cube by splitting the diagonal edge on every face so that each face is made of 4 triangls in the shape of an x.
