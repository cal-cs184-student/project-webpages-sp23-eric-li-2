        * NOTE: For this project, you will choose TWO out of the four given parts to complete. One of those parts must be Part 1 or Part 2. In other words, you can choose any combination of two parts except the pair (Part 3, Part 4).
		
		<h3> Overview </h3>
		<p>
			For this project, I completed parts 1 and 2 (Mirrors/glass and microfacets).
			The code for these parts was fairly short since it built on project 3-1 and added a few new bsdf functions.
			For implementing mirrors, I implemented reflecting bsdfs by removing the random sampling used in lambertian diffuse and replacing it with 
			a determnistic vector in the bounce direction. 
			For refractions, I did a similar thing by using snell's law.
			for glass, I used both reflection and refraction and randomly sampled whether the light beam reflected or refracted using the fresnel coefficient which 
			told me the ratio of energy for light bouncing versus refracting for air to dielectric interfaces. 

			<br>
			For part two, I implemented microfacets which is a model of surfaces as a bunch of randomly oriented specular facets.
			This involved a lot of math to model the distribution of normal vectors on the surface, a shadow masking term, and again the fresnel coefficient.
			The fresnel coefficient for this part was more complicated as the fresnel coefficient for conductors is different than dielectrics and is a function of wavelength.
			Finally, I also implemented importance sampling to help with speeding up the microfacet model. 
			This involved sampling from a distribution of random vectors that more closely resembled the distribution given by the microfacet model.
			The default hemisphere model given worked but converged much slower compared to the importance sample model I implemented.
			The function I used to sample with was called the Beckman NDF function.

            Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            For zero bounce, we only see light directly from the ceiling light.
			<br>
			For one bounce, we see light also from one bounce which includes the walls and highlights on the two spheres.
			<br>
			For two bounces, we begin to have some global illumination and can see the ceiling. 
			The shadows of the balls become lighter. 
			And we can see reflections of the scene on the mirror ball. 
			Note that with only two bounces, the scene in the mirror ball appears like the scene from one bounce since one of the bounces was consumed by the mirror. 
			The ceiling and glass ball is still dark inside the mirror.
			<br>
			For three bounces, the glass ball becomes transparent. The three bounces required for this are bouncing off a wall, entering the glass ball, and exiting the ball. 
			Note, that the glass ball inside the mirror is still black.
			We also see the light focusing in the shadow of the glass ball and see a bright spot.
			<br>
			For four bounces, the glass ball inside the mirror becomes transparent. We also get a second bright spot on the blue right wall. 
			This is from light being bounced off the mirror ball focusing through the glass ball onto the blue wall.
			<br>
			For five bounces, there is nothing new that is notable other than more detail in the mirror ball.
			<br>
			For 100 bounces, nothing really chnages other than the scene is slightly brighter.
			Also note that the scenes get progressively more noisy as we increase the depth due to the estimation of higher dimensional integrals. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>
            Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
        </b></p>
        <p>
            Zero bounce is the light directly from the lamp. No bounces are required for this to appear in the render.
			<br>
			For one bounce, we see light from the walls and highlights on the spheres.
			This is explained by the light bouncing off once on the wall and then onto the camera.
			The balls' highlights appear because at a specific region on the sphere, the normals just happen to bounce the light from the ceiling directly into the camera.
			<br>
			For two bounces, we can see the ceiling, lighting in the shadows of the balls, and reflection on the mirror ball.
			The light from the shadow of the spheres is explained by light bouncing off the wall, then into the shadow of the ball, then into the camera.
			The light from the ceiling is explained by light bouncing off the spheres and floor, then onto the ceiling, then into the camera.
			The light from the mirror is from light bouncing off the scene, then into the mirror, then into the camera.
			<br>
			For three bounces, the glass ball becomes transparent. 
			The three bounces required for this are bouncing off a wall, entering the glass ball, and exiting the ball. 
			Note, that the glass ball inside the mirror is still black.
			We also see the light focusing in the shadow of the glass ball and see a bright spot.
			This is explained by light entering the sphere, exiting the sphere, then bouncing off the floor, then into the camera.
			<br>
			For four bounces, the glass ball inside the mirror becomes transparent. We also get a second bright spot on the blue right wall. 
			This is from light being bounced off the mirror ball focusing through the glass ball onto the blue wall.
			<br>
			For five bounces, there is nothing new that is notable other than more detail in the mirror ball.
			<br>
			For 100 bounces, nothing really chnages other than the scene is slightly brighter.
			Also note that the scenes get progressively more noisy as we increase the depth due to the estimation of higher dimensional integrals. 
        </p>
		<h3> Some implemntation details </h3>
		<p> For refractions, it is important to check whether the light is entering or exiting the medium. 
			This means I had to pay attention to whether I was using ior (index of refraction) or 1 / ior (the recripocal) 
			when I needed the ratio of the indices of refraction.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 2. Microfacet Material</h3>
        <p><b>
            Show a screenshot sequence of 4 images of scene `CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae` rendered with $\alpha$ set to 0.005, 0.05, 0.25 and 0.5. The other settings should be at least 128 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5. Describe the differences between different images. Note that, to change the $\alpha$, just open the .dae file and search for `microfacet`.
        </b></p>
        <p>
            <table>
				<tr>
					<th> alpha = 0.005 </th>
					<th> alpha = 0.05 </th>

				</tr>
				</table>
        </p>
		<p>
			The difference between these images is that the dragons with lower alpha values are shinier and more specular.
			The have brighter bright spots and darker dark spots due to reflected light being more focused. 
			This light is either more focused on a spot away from the camera or more focused towards the camera, which explains the higher contrast.

        <p><b>
            Show two images of scene `CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae` rendered using cosine hemisphere sampling (default) and your importance sampling. The sampling rate should be fixed at 64 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5. Briefly discuss their difference.
        </b></p>

				<th> Importance Sampling </th>

				<th> <img src=".\img\part2\CBbunny_microfacet_cu_64_1_7_importance_sample.png"> </th>
			</tr>
			</table>
			Importance sampling converged on the correct image much faster. 
			This is because most of the light rays cast by hemisphere sampling have very low contribution to the overall exit radiance. 
			This is because for specular materials, the light is focused around the reflection directions.
			This causes the hemisphere sampling image to appear dark since most of the light rays cast don't contribute much.
			The hemisphere sampling if given enough samples would converge to the same image as importance sampling but it will take significantly longer.

		<h3> Implementation Details </h3>
        <p> Note that as alpha decreases, the images becomes more noisy and less stable. I assume this is due to floating point issues.
			As there are alpha squared terms in the denominators of a lot of the expressions used.
			another implementation detail is that I needed to discard any invalid light rays. 
			any rays with a z component less than 0, meaning the light ray is pointing inside the object, is invalid since we are assuming this object isn't transparent.
			I just simply returned a zero vector instead.
