		<h3> Overview </h3>
		<p>
			For this project, I modeled and simulated cloth using a mass and spring model. 
			The entire project revolved around the intricacies of this task which included 
			<br> - making sure the numerical integration remained stable with verlet integration
			<br> - handling collisions with other objects properly (prevent clipping through other objects)
			<br> - handling self collisions
			<br> - rendering the cloth efficentiy with shaders written in GLSL
			Some special notes about Verlet integration is that it using dampening to keep the simulation stable.
			This causes the simulation to seem more sluggish than natural but it still gives pretty good results.
			I also used the constraints that springs can't be more than 10% of the rest length and manually moved the point masses closer together if they were too far apart.
			Another note is that the self-collisions of the cloth particles were handled efficiently using a hashmap that 
			mapped points in 3d to rectangular boxes and then only enforcing constraints of particles within the box.

            Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low ks? A high ks?
        </b></p>
        <p>
			For a low ks, the animation from start to end follows this pattern.
			The cloth falls, then suddenly jerks due to the pegs and the force travels along the cloth
			causing the cloth to not fall freely anymore. Then the cloth slowly and gracefully comes to rest.
			For low ks, there is a very large and smooth sag with no wrinkles.

			For high ks, the animation from start to finish follows the same pattern except 
			the cloth becomes more taut meaning less wrinkles and less sag.
			During the fall, the cloth appears more bouncy and bounces up and down a bit before settling.
			When ks is even larger, the cloth appears scrunched up as all the internal vertices 
			pull on eachother and the two pinned vertices at the corners. 
			When k is too large, the cloth starts shaking and spasming. 
			The spasms start from the pinned vertices and propogate throughout the cloth.
			Increasing k even further causes the point masses to explode and fly off screen.

			The lower the Ks value, the thinner and more flexible the cloth.

			For example, comparing Ks=500 and Ks=50000, we see that the Ks=500 cloth has less wrinkles. 
			The Ks=500 cloth deforms more easily and warps smoothly around the ball. 
			On the other hand, the Ks=50000 cloth has many folds and does not wrap smoothly around the ball. 
			This is due to the bending forces. 
			The cloth also does not hang as low as the Ks=500 cloth as the structural and shearing forces are stronger.

        <p><b>
            Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
        </b></p>
		<p>
			A shader a program is a program that is run on the GPU. 
			The program takes in inputs (for example vertex position and normal) and returns an output (ex. transformed vertex position and normal).
			Shaders typically have a specific purpose and are modular meaning we can chain multiple shaders together.
			The output of one shader is the input of another shader. These shaders are used for the graphics pipeline and provides a means of customization for graphics programmers.
			Typically the graphics pipeline will include at least a vertex shader and a fragment shader. 
			The vertex shader typically calcualtes attributes assosciated with vertex data. 
			Material texture affects such as displacement mapping could be added at this stage to offset vertices according to a texture map. 
			and the fragment shader takes in the vertex shader's output and is part of the rasterization step of the pipeline.
			It will typically compute the final colors of pixels by interpolating the colors of vertices or calculating lighting from environment maps or material effects.
			One example of changing the lighting is bump mapping where we shift the normals of a point according to a texture map to change the lighting.

			Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
        </b></p>
        <p>
			The Blinn-Phong shading model is a model of how much light is reflected off of a surface in a certain direction.
			It models light as coming from three sources, ambient light, diffuse light, and specular light. 
			The ambient light is an approximation of global illumination and accounts for all light bouncing around the scene by approximating as a univeral glow all objects emit.
			The diffuse component models light as being scattered uniformly in all directions after hitting a surface.
			To model this, we first calculate how much light reaches the surface from a light source by accounting for the quadratic decrease in intensity with distance.
			We also account for the angle at which the light strikes with a cosine term.
			Then the light reflected in the view direction is just a scalar multiple of the light intensity striking the surface. 
			The specular component models the surface as specular, meaning shiny and reflective. The intensity of light being reflected in the view direction 
			is more complicated but utilizes a cosine to the p'th power dropoff. Meaning, the amount of light reflected drops off much more sharply when the view direction deviates from the 
			ideal mirror reflection angle. 
			<br>
			Here are some screenshots of the Blinn-Phong model being used and the components of it:

			Bump mapping changes the appearance of the object while displacement mapping changes both the look and shape of the object.

			When increasing the resolution, the bump mapping sphere's geometry just gets smoother but the appearance is the same.
			The displacement mapping on the other hand gets more defined grooves for the brick seams. It also gets more noisy and spiky from the original texture having sharp changes in grayscale value.
